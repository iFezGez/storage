# storage/

This repository documents self-hosted storage environments used in the Vesta Lab, designed for both internal lab usage and real-world client scenarios.

## Structure

- `truenas/` – Documentation for TrueNAS SCALE installations and storage pool configuration.
  - `scale/bare-metal/` – Bare-metal deployments with VLAN support, snapshots, NFS, SMB, and cloud sync.
- `nextcloud/` – (Planned) Future self-hosted file cloud solutions.

## Goals

- Provide modular, production-ready documentation for storage environments.
- Enable traceable and scalable configurations for datasets, access, backup, and recovery.
- Showcase real-world setups for professional portfolios and client proposals.

> All configurations are applied and validated in real environments.
